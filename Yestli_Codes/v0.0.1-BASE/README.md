## _About this file_
This code is only the base of the first tests. This is the code that allows the Yestli comunicates with the test app.

It does include two Yestli codes, one with comments in spanish and another one with comments in english. Both are exactly the same, the only diference is that the spanish version include some indications for my partner David and the license redirects you to the "Official" Yestli [repo](https://github.com/Yestli/Yestli-Project) (which is in spanish).
