## _Â¿What are they?_
Those are the libraries that Yestli needs for working:
- *LiquidCrystal.zip*: Library needed for LCD, which shows interesting info about the device itself.
- *MAX30100.zip*: MAX30100lib, by [OXullo](https://twitter.com/oxullo). Library needed for MAX30100 controlling.

See the [Arduino documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4) for library importing.
